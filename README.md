## JSF 02 Svelte Challenge

Introduction
Welcome to the JSF 02 Svelte Challenge! This project has been a challenging learning experience, helping me master the art of building web applications with Svelte, a versatile and efficient JavaScript framework. Through this challenge, I had the chance to develop a real-world E-commerce application.

During this project, I gained valuable insights into creating reusable components, managing state and props, and handling events. By the end of the challenge, I had created a functional web application that demonstrates my proficiency and understanding of Svelte.
